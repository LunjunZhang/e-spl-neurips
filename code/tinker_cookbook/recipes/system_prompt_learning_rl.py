    - For errors: Pinpoint where and why the reasoning went wrong
    - Note any important patterns or strategies used or missed
    - Review why some trajectories failed. Were any existing principles missed, or did the principles not provide enough guidance?

2. Update Existing Principles
    - Some trajectories may be correct and others may be wrong; you should ensure there are principles that can help achieve correct solutions
    - You can use two types of operations: ["modify", "add"]
        * "modify": You can modify a current principle to make it more helpful
        * "add": You can introduce a new principle that may be needed
    - You can make at most {max_operations} updates with clear, generalizable lessons for this case
    - Before updating each principle, you need to:
        * Specify when it would be most relevant
        * List key problem features that make this principle applicable
        * Identify similar problem patterns where this principle applies

3. Requirements for Each Principle That Is Modified or Added
    - Begin with a brief general background (a few words) in the principle
    - Focus on strategic thinking patterns, not specific calculations
    - Emphasize decision points that could be applied to similar problems

Please provide reasoning in detail under the guidance of the above three steps.
After the step-by-step reasoning, you will finish by returning a list of operations in the following JSON format:
```json

    {{
        "operation": "add",
        "principle": "the added principle",

1. It must be clear, generalizable lessons for this case, with no more than 32 words
2. Begin with general background with several words in the principle

"""


CROSSOVER_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """Each principle set listed above strictly outperformed all others on at least one question. Your task is to analyze this evidence and improve Principle Set A.

Follow these steps:

1. Evidence-Based Analysis:
   - For each question, explain WHY the best-performing set succeeded. Consider:
     * Did it have specific principle(s) that were relevant and helpful? If not, did it succeed because other sets had counterproductive principles on this topic? How likely was the success due to chance, or due to targeted guidance by specific principles?
   - Cite principle IDs (e.g., A.G3, B.G7) and question IDs (e.g., Q.0, Q.5) where applicable.

2. What to Preserve and What to Change in Set A:
   - For each question where Set A performed best: Which Set A principles likely contributed to its success? These should be preserved.
   - For each question where other sets performed best: Did they have useful principles Set A lacked? Or did Set A have a principle that was relevant to this question type but led to worse reasoning? Consider whether the difference is meaningful or likely due to chance.
   - Note: Principles that are simply irrelevant to the current batch of questions should be left alone - they may be useful for other problem types.

3. Propose Evidence-Grounded Improvements:
   - Think about how to improve Principle Set A. The improvement plan should be supported by evidence from the questions above, but use your judgment when the evidence is indirect.
   - Any additions or modifications to Set A should be based on or inspired by successful principles from other sets, not invented from scratch.
   - Note: Do not output JSON during your reasoning. Only output JSON once, at the very end.

You can use three types of operations to improve Principle Set A:
* "add": Introduce a new principle to Principle Set A (inspired by principles that helped other sets)
* "modify": Modify an existing principle in Principle Set A
* "remove": Remove a principle from Principle Set A that appears to be counterproductive

Please provide detailed reasoning following the above three steps, with explicit citations to principle IDs and question IDs throughout.

After the step-by-step reasoning, return a list of operations in the following JSON format:
```json
[
    {
        "operation": "add",
        "evidence": "Set B performed best on Q.3 and Q.7 using B.G5, which addresses X that Set A lacks",
        "principle": "the new principle to add"
    },
    {
        "operation": "modify",
        "modified_from": "A.G17",
        "evidence": "A.G17 helped on Q.1, but Set B performed best on Q.4 which needed stronger guidance on Y",
        "principle": "the modified principle"
    },
    {
        "operation": "remove",
        "remove_id": "A.G5",
        "evidence": "Set B performed best on Q.8 and Q.12 where A.G5 likely misled the reasoning"
    },
    ...
]
```

You do not need to use all operation types. Only propose operations that are clearly supported by the evidence. If the evidence does not strongly support any changes, it is acceptable to return an empty list.
